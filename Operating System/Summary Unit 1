# 💻 Operating System – Unit 1

## Introduction to Operating System

### 1️⃣ Operating System (OS)

OS ek system software hai jo:
- User aur hardware ke beech interface provide karta hai
- Hardware resources manage karta hai

**Examples:**
- Windows
- Linux
- macOS

### 2️⃣ Objectives of OS
- Convenience
- Efficiency
- Resource management

### 3️⃣ Types of Operating Systems
1. **Batch OS**
   - Jobs executed in batches
   - No user interaction
2. **Multiprogramming OS**
   - Multiple programs in memory
   - CPU utilization increase
3. **Time Sharing OS**
   - CPU time divided among users
   - Fast response
4. **Real-Time OS**
   - Strict timing constraints
 
   - Used in robotics, traffic control

### 4️⃣ OS Services
- Process management
- Memory management
 
- File management
 
- I/O management
 
- Security
 
 
### 5️⃣ Program vs Process
description:
| Program | Process |
|---------|---------|
| Passive | Active |
| Stored on disk | Loaded in RAM |
| No resources | Uses CPU, memory |
 
### 6️⃣ Process States:
- New
 
- Ready
 
- Running
 
- Waiting (Blocked)
 
- Terminated
 
 
### 7️⃣ Process Control Block (PCB)
a data structure jo process information store karta hai.
**Contents:**
p-	Process ID,
p-	Process state,
p-	Program counter,
p-	CPU registers,
p-	Memory info,
p-	I/O status.
 
 
### 8️⃣ Threads & Multithreading:
a) Thread: Lightweight process, shares memory of process.
b) Process vs Thread:
